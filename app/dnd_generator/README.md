# DND Generator
This project is to help learn the basics of Python.  The actual project is to generate helpful content for Dungeon Masters in Dungeons & Dragons.  Currently, I am working on auto generatings NPCs and taverns.  The current approach is to have txt files that are used to generate names and such.  The application looks into each of these files and often pulls out a line at random to be used for an NPC or tavern.

The end goal for this program is to continue adding components that can be auto generated for the DM. Right now, I am starting with NPCs, then a number of places like taverns, shops, town squares that are populated by NPCs that are generated.  Then, once that is completed move on to generating, villages, towns, and cities with the building blocks that I have completed.

I am doing this in my spare time to learn Python basics. The lists are rough and ready and not exactly tailored to D&D, which makes some of the auto-generations humorous, but that's the fun of it.
